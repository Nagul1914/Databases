image

What is Fault-Tolerant?
Fault-tolerance refers to the ability of a system to continue functioning correctly even in the presence of hardware or software failures. A fault-tolerant system is designed to ensure high availability and reliability by handling failures gracefully without affecting the overall performance or functionality.

In distributed databases (like Cassandra or HBase), fault tolerance is achieved through mechanisms such as:

Replication: Data is copied across multiple nodes so that if one node fails, the data is still accessible from another node.
Failover: If a system component fails, the workload is automatically redirected to a backup or secondary component.
Redundancy: Critical components have backups to ensure that even in case of a failure, operations can continue smoothly.
What is Sparse Data in HBase?
In HBase, sparse data refers to datasets where most of the data points are missing or not present in a large number of cells. HBase stores data in a column-family structure, where different rows can have different columns. This flexibility allows HBase to efficiently store sparse data by only storing columns that contain actual data and leaving out the missing ones.

Key points about sparse data in HBase:

Efficient Storage: Only columns with data are stored, saving space in cases where most columns are empty.
Dynamic Schema: Rows can have different sets of columns, making it easier to handle data with missing or irregular values.
Wide Columns: HBase can store millions of columns in a row, but typically only a few are populated, representing a sparse structure.
In summary, HBase's column-oriented design is optimized for handling sparse data, making it a good choice for applications with incomplete datasets or irregular structures.

Key Features:
Column-Oriented Store: HBase stores data in a column-family format, which allows for efficient retrieval of large datasets and operations on subsets of columns.
